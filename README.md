# 2D Platformer
For our final project, I made a scrolling 2D Platformer (like Mario). The player controls an animated character moving across the screen to navigate past different obstacles, such as enemies or separated platforms. The goal of the game is to make it as far as you can while collecting coins for points. 

## Project Requirements

- Must allow the player to control an animated character capable of moving across the screen

  - In addition to moving left or right, the character should also be able to jump

  - The character’s sprite should change based on its state (i.e., standing still, running, jumping, etc.)

  - You may (but do not have to) include other character behavior, such as attacking, sprinting, etc.

- Must provide a varied environment for the player to navigate (i.e., changing terrain, floating platforms, etc.)

  - Camera should scroll to follow the player, either automatically (forcing the player to stay within its bounds) or in response to player’s current location

- Must provide a series of interesting obstacles for the player to overcome (possible examples of obstacles include enemies for the player to face, gaps that need to be jumped, and other environmental hazards such as spikes, swinging blades, or flame jets)

- Must provide some kind of scoring mechanic (possible examples include optional collectibles such as coins or killable enemies, keeping track of the time taken to complete the level, or tracking how long the player can stay alive in an infinitely spawning level) 

- Must implement the following standard game features:

  - A start screen and end screen (e.g., new scenes, UI pop-ups, etc.)

  - UI elements for tracking game information (e.g., text displays for player lives and player score)

  - Audio (e.g., background music and sound effects for game events such as moving or firing)

  - Audio settings that are saved (e.g., mute and volume in PlayerPrefs)

  - High scores that are saved (e.g., top 5 high scores in PlayerPrefs)
